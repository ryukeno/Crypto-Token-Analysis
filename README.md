# Project 6 - VC Startup Fundings

# Project Description

This project is part of the IronHack Data Analytics Bootcamp and its goal is to practice creating and interpreting different types of visualizations using real world data, as well as statistical analysis.



# Questions and Hypotheses

I was interested in understanding the distribution of investments accross the world and investigate in potential links between a companies success and the amount it manages to raise during its ***Seed Stage***, which is the initial first investment companies receives from VC funding. You can have further informations about the various rounds of investment here :

Specifically, i wanted to answer the following:

What is the repartition of Venture Capital around the world ? 
Where does the highest fundraising takes place ? 
What type ( product )  of companies has more chances to be successful and raise funds, and does this sees a variation depending on the country ?
Is there a particular correlation between ***Seed*** initial investment and a companies future success.

# Data
***Crunchbase Venture Capital Startup Funding***

I decided to analyze a popular Dataset about Venture Capital Startups funding from various countries. The dataset is available on Kaggle at this address : https://www.kaggle.com/arindam235/startup-investments-crunchbase. The data originally comes from Crunchbase.

# Workflow 

***1. Data Cleaning***

***2. Exploratory Data Analysis***

***3. Tableau Presentation on relevant metrics gathered from the EDA***


# Conclusion

It is impossible to say with certainty that a company's future success is not linked to its first initial investment during seed stage however we can clearly notice that companies like Facebook for instance have not raised any funding.

I would need to go deeper in the analysis and find other factors (qualitative as well as quantitative) that might affect a companies future success, and confirm this by analysing then other samples of startups that raised fund through VC.
